# kinect-toolbox
## Overview
This is a set of helper functions that I wrote to make using the Microsoft Kinect V2 with python easier. In my opinion the "C++ like" terminology of the pylibfreenect2 library is cumbersome and difficult. With this wrapper the kinect can be used more like a cv2 webcam. Provides methods to get color, depth, registered color, registered depth, and ir images, record video, get point clouds (quickly), create synthetic depth images, and select and return a region of interest. Point cloud acceleration methods are based partially on this [stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41241236/vectorizing-the-kinect-real-world-coordinate-processing-algorithm-for-speed) asked by user Logic1, which I thought was really neat.

## Installation
1) [Install libfreenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2) 
2) Update your paths:
    ```bash
    export LIBFREENECT2_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/freenect2
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/freenect2/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```
3) Install required python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If you run into `No module named 'numpy'` error, use pip to manually install numpy and cyton first, then install from the requirements file. 
4) Test installation:
    ```bash
    python test.py
    ```

## Usage
```python
import cv2
from kinecttb import Kinect, KFrame

k = Kinect()
while True:
    # Specify as many types as you want here
    color_frame = k.get_frame(KFrame.COLOR)

    cv2.imshow('frame', color_frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break
```

## Methods
#### get_frame
Get a video frame from the kinect. Optionally specify a list of image types and the function will return a corresponding list of images. Available types are:
* KFrame.RAW_COLOR - returns a 1920 x 1080 color image
* KFrame.RAW_DEPTH - returns a 512 x 424 depth image (units are mm)
* KFrame.COLOR     - returns a 512 x 424 color image, registered to depth image
* KFrame.DEPTH     - returns a 512 x 424 undistorted depth, image (units are mm)
* KFrame.IR        - returns a 512 x 424 ir image

Note that depth images have units in millimeters. To display them in a window without clipping first rescale the values:
```python
frame = frame / 4500.
```

#### record
Records a video from the kinect. Halts execution and opens a cv2 window displaying a stream from the kinect while writing the stream to disk. Optionally specify any of the above frame types to record that specific stream.

#### get_ptcld
Get a point cloud from the kinect. Returns an point cloud of size [512, 424, 3], corresponding a grid of xyz points. Optionally return a color map derived from the registered color image.

#### get_perspective_depth
Get a simulated depth map from anywhere in the scene by specifying a principal point, viewing vector, and fov. The depth map is generated by tilting a point cloud so that the viewing vector is coincident with the z axis, identifying those points that are within the specified fov, and filling in pixels of the depth map based on whether or not a point appears there.

#### get_roi
Functions as a wrapper for the opencv method selectROI. When called, collects a new frame of the type specified, opens a cv2 window and allows the user to select a region.
